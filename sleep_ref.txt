---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> Consider parent thread P with child thread C.  How do you ensure
>> proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P calls wait(C)
>> before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure that all resources
>> are freed in each case?  How about when P terminates without waiting,
>> before C exits?  After C exits?  Are there any special cases?
